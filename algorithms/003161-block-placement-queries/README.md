3161\. Block Placement Queries

**Difficulty:** Hard

**Topics:** `Principal`, `Array`, `Binary Search`, `Binary Indexed Tree`, `Segment Tree`, `Biweekly Contest 131`

There exists an infinite number line, with its origin at 0 and extending towards the positive x-axis.

You are given a 2D array `queries`, which contains two types of queries:

1. For a query of type 1, `queries[i] = [1, x]`. Build an obstacle at distance `x` from the origin. It is guaranteed that there is no obstacle at distance `x` when the query is asked.
2. For a query of type 2, `queries[i] = [2, x, sz]`. Check if it is possible to place a block of size `sz` _anywhere_ in the range `[0, x]` on the line, such that the block **entirely** lies in the range `[0, x]`. A block **cannot** be placed if it intersects with any obstacle, but it may touch it. Note that you do **not** actually place the block. Queries are separate.

Return a boolean array `results`, where `results[i]` is `true` if you can place the block specified in the `iᵗʰ` query of type 2, and `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**

- **Input:** queries = [[1,2],[2,3,3],[2,3,1],[2,2,2]]
- **Output:** [false,true,true]
- **Explanation:**
   ![example0block](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/04/22/example0block.png)
   For query 0, place an obstacle at `x = 2`. A block of size at most 2 can be placed before `x = 3`.

**Example 2:**

- **Input:** queries = [[1,7],[2,7,6],[1,2],[2,7,5],[2,7,6]]
- **Output:** [true,true,false]
- **Explanation:**
   ![example1block](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/04/22/example1block.png)
   - Place an obstacle at `x = 7` for query 0. A block of size at most 7 can be placed before `x = 7`.
   - Place an obstacle at `x = 2` for query 2. Now, a block of size at most 5 can be placed before `x = 7`, and a block of size at most 2 before `x = 2`.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= queries.length <= 15 * 10⁴`
- `2 <= queries[i].length <= 3`
- `1 <= queries[i][0] <= 2`
- `1 <= x, sz <= min(5 * 10⁴, 3 * queries.length)`
- The input is generated such that for queries of type 1, no obstacle exists at distance `x` when the query is asked.
- The input is generated such that there is at least one query of type 2.



**Hint:**
1. Let `d[x]` be the distance of the next obstacle after `x`.
2. For each query of type 2, we just need to check if `max(d[0], d[1], d[2], …d[x - sz]) > sz`.
3. Use segment tree to maintain `d[x]`.

**Solution:**

The problem involves handling two types of queries on an infinite positive number line:
- **Type 1:** Place an obstacle at a given coordinate.
- **Type 2:** Check if a block of a given size can fit entirely within a range `[0, x]` without intersecting any obstacles (touching is allowed).

The solution uses a **segment tree** to maintain the largest gap starting at each position between obstacles, and a sorted list of obstacles to efficiently update and query gaps. It answers each query in **O(log n)** time.

### Approach:

- **Segment tree** stores, for each position `i`, the size of the gap starting at `i` (i.e., the distance to the next obstacle to the right).
- **Obstacles list** is kept sorted to allow binary search for predecessor and successor.
- **Sentinel obstacle** at `0` simplifies gap tracking.
- For **type 2 queries**, we first check the partial gap from the last obstacle to `x`. If that fits, answer is `true`. Otherwise, we query the segment tree for the maximum gap starting anywhere in `[0, x - sz]`.
- For **type 1 queries**, we find predecessor and successor obstacles, update the gaps for both ends, and insert the new obstacle into the sorted list.

Let's implement this solution in PHP: **[3161. Block Placement Queries](https://github.com/mah-shamim/leet-code-in-php/tree/main/algorithms/003161-block-placement-queries/solution.php)**

```php
<?php
/**
 * @param Integer[][] $queries
 * @return Boolean[]
 */
function getResults(array $queries): array
{
    ...
    ...
    ...
    /**
     * go to ./solution.php
     */
}

// Test cases
echo getResults([[1,2],[2,3,3],[2,3,1],[2,2,2]]) . "\n";                // Output: [false,true,true]
echo getResults([[1,7],[2,7,6],[1,2],[2,7,5],[2,7,6]]) . "\n";          // Output: [true,true,false]
?>
```

### Explanation:

- **Initialization:** Start with obstacle at `0` and a large initial gap from `0` to `maxVal` (an upper bound slightly larger than any given coordinate).
- **Type 1 (add obstacle at `p`):**
   - Find predecessor `L` and successor `R` using binary search on sorted obstacles list.
   - Update segment tree at `L` with new gap `p - L`.
   - Update segment tree at `p` with new gap `R - p`.
   - Insert `p` into sorted obstacles.
- **Type 2 (query for `sz` in `[0, x]`):**
   - If `sz > x`, immediately return `false`.
   - Find last obstacle `lastObs ≤ x` using binary search.
   - If `x - lastObs ≥ sz`, return `true` (fits in rightmost gap).
   - Otherwise, query segment tree for max gap in `[0, x - sz]`. If that max gap ≥ `sz`, return `true`, else `false`.
- **Segment tree operations:**
   - `set(idx, val)` updates position `idx` with new gap size.
   - `max(l, r)` returns largest gap size in range `[l, r]`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**:
   - Type 1: Binary search + segment tree updates → **O(log n)**
   - Type 2: Binary search + segment tree query → **O(log n)**
   - Total: **O(q log n)** where `q` is number of queries, `n` is range size.
- **Space Complexity**:
   - Segment tree: **O(n)**
   - Obstacles list: **O(q)**
   - Total: **O(n + q)** where `n = maxVal`.
