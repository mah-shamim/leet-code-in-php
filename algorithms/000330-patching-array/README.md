330\. Patching Array

**Difficulty:** Hard

**Topics:** `Array`, `Greedy`

Given a sorted integer array `nums` and an integer `n`, add/patch elements to the array such that any number in the range `[1, n]` inclusive can be formed by the sum of some elements in the array.

Return _the minimum number of patches required_.

**Example 1:**

- **Input:** nums = [1,3], n = 6
- **Output:** 1
- **Explanation:**\
  Combinations of nums are [1], [3], [1,3], which form possible sums of: 1, 3, 4.\
  Now if we add/patch 2 to nums, the combinations are: [1], [2], [3], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3].\
  Possible sums are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, which now covers the range [1, 6].\
  So we only need 1 patch.

**Example 2:**

- **Input:** nums = [1,5,10], n = 20
- **Output:** 2
- **Explanation:** The two patches can be [2, 4].

**Example 3:**

- **Input:** nums = [1,2,2], n = 5
- **Output:** 0 

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 <= nums.length <= 1000</code>
- <code>1 <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
- `nums` is sorted in **ascending order**.
- <code>1 <= n <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1</code>
- **Only one valid answer exists.**


**Solution:**

We need to ensure that every number in the range `[1, n]` can be formed by the sum of some elements in the given array. We can use a greedy algorithm to determine the minimum number of patches required.

### Solution Explanation:

1. **Key Insight**:
   - Start with the smallest missing number `miss` which starts at 1.
   - Iterate through the array `nums`. If the current number in `nums` is less than or equal to `miss`, then `miss` can be covered by adding this number. Otherwise, we need to patch `miss` to the array, effectively doubling the range that can be covered.

2. **Algorithm**:
   - Initialize `miss = 1` and `patches = 0`.
   - Loop through the array while `miss <= n`:
     - If the current number in `nums` can cover `miss`, move to the next number in `nums`.
     - If the current number is greater than `miss`, patch `miss` and double the range covered by setting `miss = miss * 2`.
   - Continue until the entire range `[1, n]` is covered.

3. **Complexity**:
  - The time complexity is O(m + log n), where `m` is the size of the array `nums`.


Let's implement this solution in PHP: **[330. Patching Array](https://github.com/mah-shamim/leet-code-in-php/tree/main/algorithms/000330-patching-array/solution.php)**

```php
<?php
/**
* @param String $n
* @return String
*/
function minPatches($nums, $n) {
    ...
    ...
    ...
    /**
     * go to ./solution.php
     */
}

// Example usage:

// Example 1
$nums1 = [1, 3];
$n1 = 6;
echo minPatches($nums1, $n1); // Output: 1

// Example 2
$nums2 = [1, 5, 10];
$n2 = 20;
echo minPatches($nums2, $n2); // Output: 2

// Example 3
$nums3 = [1, 2, 2];
$n3 = 5;
echo minPatches($nums3, $n3); // Output: 0
?>
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Setup**: We initialize `miss` as 1, meaning we want to ensure we can generate the number 1.
- **While Loop**: We loop until `miss` exceeds `n` (the maximum number we need to cover). In each iteration:
  - If the current number in `nums` can help cover `miss`, we add it to `miss` and move to the next number.
  - If not, we "patch" the array by effectively adding `miss` to it (without changing the array itself) and then update `miss` to cover the new range.
- **Output**: The total number of patches required is returned.

This algorithm ensures that we cover the entire range `[1, n]` with the minimum number of patches.
