2326\. Spiral Matrix IV

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Topics:** `Array`, `Linked List`, `Matrix`, `Simulation`

You are given two integers `m` and `n`, which represent the dimensions of a matrix.

You are also given the `head` of a linked list of integers.

Generate an `m x n` matrix that contains the integers in the linked list presented in **spiral** order (**clockwise**), starting from the **top-left** of the matrix. If there are remaining empty spaces, fill them with `-1`.

Return _the generated matrix_.

**Example 1:**

![ex1new](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/05/09/ex1new.jpg)

- **Input:** m = 3, n = 5, head = [3,0,2,6,8,1,7,9,4,2,5,5,0]
- **Output:** [[3,0,2,6,8],[5,0,-1,-1,1],[5,2,4,9,7]]
- **Explanation:** The diagram above shows how the values are printed in the matrix.\
  Note that the remaining spaces in the matrix are filled with -1.

**Example 2:**

![ex2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/05/11/ex2.jpg)

- **Input:** m = 1, n = 4, head = [0,1,2]
- **Output:** [[0,1,2,-1]]
- **Explanation:** The diagram above shows how the values are printed from left to right in the matrix.\
  The last space in the matrix is set to -1.


**Example 3:**

- **Input:** cost = [[2, 5, 1], [3, 4, 7], [8, 1, 2], [6, 2, 4], [3, 8, 8]]
- **Output:** 10



**Constraints:**

- <code>1 <= m, n <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
- <code>1 <= m, n <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, m * n]`.
- <code>0 <= Node.val <= 1000</code>


**Hint:**
1. First, generate an m x n matrix filled with -1s.
2. Navigate within the matrix at (i, j) with the help of a direction vector ‚ü®di, dj‚ü©. At (i, j), you need to decide if you can keep going in the current direction.
3. If you cannot keep going, rotate the direction vector clockwise by 90 degrees.



**Solution:**

We will simulate a spiral traversal of an `m x n` matrix, filling it with values from a linked list. The remaining positions that don't have corresponding linked list values will be filled with `-1`.

Here's how the solution is structured:

1. **Matrix Initialization**: We first create an `m x n` matrix initialized with `-1`.
2. **Direction Vectors**: The spiral movement can be controlled using a direction vector that cycles through the right, down, left, and up directions. This ensures that we are traversing the matrix in a spiral manner.
3. **Linked List Iteration**: We traverse through the linked list, placing values in the matrix in spiral order.
4. **Boundary Handling**: We check if we've reached the boundary or encountered an already filled cell. If so, we change direction (clockwise).

Let's implement this solution in PHP: **[2326. Spiral Matrix IV](https://github.com/mah-shamim/leet-code-in-php/tree/main/algorithms/002326-spiral-matrix-iv/solution.php)**

```php
<?php
class ListNode {
    public $val = 0;
    public $next = null;
    function __construct($val = 0, $next = null) {
        $this->val = $val;
        $this->next = $next;
    }
}
/**
 * @param Integer $m
 * @param Integer $n
 * @param ListNode $head
 * @return Integer[][]
 */
function spiralMatrix($m, $n, $head) {
    ...
    ...
    ...
    /**
     * go to ./solution.php
     */
}

// Helper function to print the matrix (for debugging)
function printMatrix($matrix) {
    foreach ($matrix as $row) {
        echo implode(" ", $row) . "\n";
    }
}

// Example usage:
// Create the linked list: [3,0,2,6,8,1,7,9,4,2,5,5,0]
$head = new ListNode(3);
$head->next = new ListNode(0);
$head->next->next = new ListNode(2);
$head->next->next->next = new ListNode(6);
$head->next->next->next->next = new ListNode(8);
$head->next->next->next->next->next = new ListNode(1);
$head->next->next->next->next->next->next = new ListNode(7);
$head->next->next->next->next->next->next->next = new ListNode(9);
$head->next->next->next->next->next->next->next->next = new ListNode(4);
$head->next->next->next->next->next->next->next->next->next = new ListNode(2);
$head->next->next->next->next->next->next->next->next->next->next = new ListNode(5);
$head->next->next->next->next->next->next->next->next->next->next->next = new ListNode(5);
$head->next->next->next->next->next->next->next->next->next->next->next->next = new ListNode(0);

$m = 3;
$n = 5;

$matrix = spiralMatrix($m, $n, $head);
printMatrix($matrix);
?>
```

### Explanation:

1. **Matrix Initialization**: The matrix is initialized with `-1` so that any unfilled spaces will remain `-1` by default.

2. **Spiral Movement**:
   - The direction vector `dirs` manages movement in four directions: right, down, left, and up.
   - The index `dirIndex` keeps track of the current direction. After moving in one direction, we calculate the next position and check if it's valid. If not, we change the direction.

3. **Linked List Traversal**:
   - We traverse through the linked list nodes, placing values in the matrix one by one, following the spiral order.

4. **Boundary and Direction Change**:
   - When we encounter an invalid position (out of bounds or already filled), we rotate the direction by 90 degrees (i.e., change the direction vector).

### Time Complexity:

- Filling the matrix takes O(m \* n) because we are traversing every cell once. Hence, the time complexity is O(m \* n), which is efficient given the constraints.
