**129\. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers**

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Topics:** `Tree`, `Depth-First Search`, `Binary Tree`

You are given the root of a binary tree containing digits from `0` to `9` only.

Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

- For example, the root-to-leaf path `1 -> 2 -> 3` represents the number `123`.

Return _the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers_. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a **32-bit** integer.

A **leaf** node is a node with no children.


**Example 1:**

- **Input:** <code>**root = [1,2,3]**</code>
- **Output:** <code>**25**</code>
- **Explanation:** 
  - <code>**The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.**</code>
  - <code>**The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.**</code>
  - <code>**Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.**</code>

**Example 2:**

- **Input:** <code>**root = [4,9,0,5,1]**</code>
- **Output:** <code>**1026**</code>
- **Explanation:**
  - <code>**The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.**</code>
  - <code>**The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.**</code>
  - <code>**The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.**</code>
  - <code>**Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.**</code>

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
- The depth of the tree will not exceed `10`.


**Solution:**


We can use a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach. The idea is to traverse the tree, keeping track of the number formed by the path from the root to the current node. When you reach a leaf node, you add the current number to the total sum.

Let's implement this solution in PHP: **[129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers](https://github.com/mah-shamim/leet-code-in-php/tree/main/algorithms/000129-sum-root-to-leaf-numbers/solution.php)**

```php
<?php
// Example usage:

// Example 1
$root1 = new TreeNode(1);
$root1->left = new TreeNode(2);
$root1->right = new TreeNode(3);
echo sumNumbers($root1); // Output: 25

// Example 2
$root2 = new TreeNode(4);
$root2->left = new TreeNode(9);
$root2->right = new TreeNode(0);
$root2->left->left = new TreeNode(5);
$root2->left->right = new TreeNode(1);
echo sumNumbers($root2); // Output: 1026

?>
```

### Explanation:

1. **TreeNode Class**: This class represents each node of the binary tree. Each node has a value (`val`), a left child (`left`), and a right child (`right`).

2. **sumNumbers Function**: This is the main function that initiates the DFS traversal by calling the `sumNumbersRecu` function with the root node and an initial `currentSum` of 0.

3. **sumNumbersRecu Function**:
  - **Base Case**: If the node is `null`, return 0 (this handles the case where there is no child node).
  - **Update Current Sum**: For each node, update the `currentSum` by multiplying the previous `currentSum` by 10 and adding the node's value.
  - **Leaf Node Check**: If the node is a leaf (i.e., it has no left or right child), return the `currentSum` as this represents the number formed by the path from the root to this leaf.
  - **Recursive Calls**: If the node is not a leaf, recursively call `sumNumbersRecu` on both the left and right children and return their sum.

### Edge Cases:

- The function handles cases where the tree has only one node.
- It correctly computes the sum even for deeper trees, as the depth of the tree will not exceed 10 (as per the problem constraints).

This solution runs efficiently with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because each node is visited exactly once. The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack.
