2661\. First Completely Painted Row or Column

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Topics:** `Array`, `Hash Table`, `Matrix`

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `arr`, and an `m x n` integer **matrix** `mat`. `arr` and `mat` both contain **all** the integers in the range `[1, m * n]`.

Go through each index `i` in `arr` starting from index `0` and paint the cell in `mat` containing the integer `arr[i]`.

Return _the smallest index `i` at which either a row or a column will be completely painted in `mat`_.

**Example 1:**

![grid1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/01/18/grid1.jpg)

- **Input:** arr = [1,3,4,2], mat = [[1,4],[2,3]]
- **Output:** 2
- **Explanation:** The moves are shown in order, and both the first row and second column of the matrix become fully painted at `arr[2]`.

**Example 2:**

![grid2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/01/18/grid2.jpg)

- **Input:** arr = [2,8,7,4,1,3,5,6,9], mat = [[3,2,5],[1,4,6],[8,7,9]]
- **Output:** 3
- **Explanation:** The second column becomes fully painted at `arr[3]`.



**Constraints:**

- `m == mat.length`
- `n = mat[i].length`
- `arr.length == m * n`
- <code>1 <= m, n <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
- <code>1 <= m * n <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
- `1 <= arr[i], mat[r][c] <= m * n`
- All the integers of `arr` are **unique**.
- All the integers of `mat` are **unique**.


**Hint:**
1. Can we use a frequency array?
2. Pre-process the positions of the values in the matrix.
3. Traverse the array and increment the corresponding row and column frequency using the pre-processed positions.
4. If the row frequency becomes equal to the number of columns, or vice-versa return the current index.



**Solution:**

We can follow these steps:

### Approach

1. **Pre-process the positions of elements**:
   - First, we need to store the positions of the elements in the matrix. We can create a dictionary (`position_map`) that maps each value in the matrix to its `(row, col)` position.

2. **Frequency Arrays**:
   - We need two frequency arrays: one for the rows and one for the columns.
   - As we go through the `arr` array, we will increment the frequency of the respective row and column for each element.

3. **Check for Complete Row or Column**:
   - After each increment, check if any row or column becomes completely painted (i.e., its frequency reaches the size of the matrix's columns or rows).
   - If so, return the current index.

4. **Return the result**:
   - The index where either a row or column is fully painted is our answer.

### Detailed Steps
1. Create a map `position_map` for each value in `mat` to its `(row, col)` position.
2. Create arrays `row_count` and `col_count` to track the number of painted cells in each row and column.
3. Traverse through `arr` and for each element, update the respective row and column counts.
4. If at any point a row or column is completely painted, return that index.

Let's implement this solution in PHP: **[2661. First Completely Painted Row or Column](https://github.com/mah-shamim/leet-code-in-php/tree/main/algorithms/002661-first-completely-painted-row-or-column/solution.php)**

```php
<?php
/**
 * @param Integer[] $arr
 * @param Integer[][] $mat
 * @return Integer
 */
function firstCompleteIndex($arr, $mat) {
    ...
    ...
    ...
    /**
     * go to ./solution.php
     */
}

// Example usage:
$arr = [1, 3, 4, 2];
$mat = [[1, 4], [2, 3]];
echo firstCompleteIndex($arr, $mat); // Output: 2

$arr = [2, 8, 7, 4, 1, 3, 5, 6, 9];
$mat = [[3, 2, 5], [1, 4, 6], [8, 7, 9]];
echo firstCompleteIndex($arr, $mat); // Output: 3
?>
```

### Explanation:

1. **Pre-processing positions**:
   - We build a dictionary `position_map` where each value in `mat` is mapped to its `(row, col)` position. This helps in directly accessing the position of any value in constant time during the traversal of `arr`.

2. **Frequency counts**:
   - We initialize `row_count` and `col_count` arrays with zeros. These arrays will keep track of how many times a cell in a specific row or column has been painted.

3. **Traversing the array**:
   - For each value in `arr`, we look up its position in `position_map`, then increment the corresponding row and column counts.
   - After updating the counts, we check if any row or column has reached its full size (i.e., `row_count[$row] == n` or `col_count[$col] == m`). If so, we return the current index `i`.

4. **Return Result**:
   - The first index where either a row or column is completely painted is returned.

### Time Complexity:
- **Pre-processing**: We build `position_map` in `O(m * n)`.
- **Traversal**: We process each element of `arr` (which has a length of `m * n`), and for each element, we perform constant-time operations to update and check the row and column frequencies, which takes `O(1)` time.
- Overall, the time complexity is `O(m * n)`.

### Space Complexity:
- We store the positions of all elements in `position_map`, and we use `O(m + n)` space for the frequency arrays. Therefore, the space complexity is `O(m * n)`.

This solution should efficiently handle the problem within the given constraints.
