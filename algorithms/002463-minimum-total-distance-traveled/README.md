2463\. Minimum Total Distance Traveled

**Difficulty:** Hard

**Topics:** `Array`, `Dynamic Programming`, `Sorting`

There are some robots and factories on the X-axis. You are given an integer array `robot` where `robot[i]` is the position of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> robot. You are also given a 2D integer array factory where <code>factory[j] = [position<sub>j</sub>, limit<sub>j</sub>]</code> indicates that <code>position<sub>j</sub></code> is the position of the <code>j<sub>th</sub></code> factory and that the <code>j<sub>th</sub></code> factory can repair at most <code>limit<sub>j</sub></code> robots.

The positions of each robot are **unique**. The positions of each factory are also **unique**. Note that a robot can be **in the same position** as a factory initially.

All the robots are initially broken; they keep moving in one direction. The direction could be the negative or the positive direction of the X-axis. When a robot reaches a factory that did not reach its limit, the factory repairs the robot, and it stops moving.

**At any moment**, you can set the initial direction of moving for **some** robot. Your target is to minimize the total distance traveled by all the robots.

Return _the minimum total distance traveled by all the robots_. The test cases are generated such that all the robots can be repaired.

**Note that**

- All robots move at the same speed.
- If two robots move in the same direction, they will never collide.
- If two robots move in opposite directions and they meet at some point, they do not collide. They cross each other.
- If a robot passes by a factory that reached its limits, it crosses it as if it does not exist.
- If the robot moved from a position `x` to a position `y`, the distance it moved is `|y - x|`.


**Example 1:**

![example1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/09/15/example1.jpg)

- **Input:** robot = [0,4,6], factory = [[2,2],[6,2]]
- **Output:** 4
- **Explanation:** As shown in the figure:
  - The first robot at position 0 moves in the positive direction. It will be repaired at the first factory.
  - The second robot at position 4 moves in the negative direction. It will be repaired at the first factory.
  - The third robot at position 6 will be repaired at the second factory. It does not need to move.
  - The limit of the first factory is 2, and it fixed 2 robots.
  - The limit of the second factory is 2, and it fixed 1 robot.
  - The total distance is |2 - 0| + |2 - 4| + |6 - 6| = 4. It can be shown that we cannot achieve a better total distance than 4.

**Example 2:**

![example-2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/09/15/example-2.jpg)

- **Input:** robot = [1,-1], factory = [[-2,1],[2,1]]
- **Output:** 2
- **Explanation:** As shown in the figure:
  - The first robot at position 1 moves in the positive direction. It will be repaired at the second factory.
  - The second robot at position -1 moves in the negative direction. It will be repaired at the first factory.
  - The limit of the first factory is 1, and it fixed 1 robot.
  - The limit of the second factory is 1, and it fixed 1 robot.
  - The total distance is |2 - 1| + |(-2) - (-1)| = 2. It can be shown that we cannot achieve a better total distance than 2.


**Constraints:**

- `1 <= robot.length, factory.length <= 100`
- `factory[j].length == 2`
- <code>-10<sup>9</sup> <= robot[i], positionj <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>
- <code>0 <= limit<sub>j</sub> <= robot.length</code>
- The input will be generated such that it is always possible to repair every robot.


**Hint:**
1. Sort robots and factories by their positions.
2. After sorting, notice that each factory should repair some subsegment of robots.
3. Find the minimum total distance to repair first i robots with first j factories.



**Solution:**

We can use dynamic programming with sorted `robot` and `factory` arrays. The idea is to minimize the distance each robot must travel to be repaired by a factory, respecting each factory‚Äôs repair capacity. Here‚Äôs a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Sort the `robot` and `factory` arrays by position**. Sorting helps in minimizing the travel distance as we can assign nearby robots to nearby factories.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: We define a 2D DP table `dp[i][j]` where:
   - `i` represents the first `i` robots.
   - `j` represents the first `j` factories.
   - `dp[i][j]` stores the minimum total distance for repairing these `i` robots using these `j` factories.

3. **State Transition**:
   - For each factory, try to repair a subset of consecutive robots within its limit.
   - For a factory `j` at position `p`, calculate the minimum distance required for assigning `k` robots to it by summing the distances from each robot to the factory's position.
   - Update the DP state by selecting the minimum between repairing fewer robots or utilizing the factory capacity to the fullest.

Let's implement this solution in PHP: **[2463. Minimum Total Distance Traveled](https://github.com/mah-shamim/leet-code-in-php/tree/main/algorithms/002463-minimum-total-distance-traveled/solution.php)**

```php
<?php
/**
 * @param Integer[] $robot
 * @param Integer[][] $factory
 * @return Integer
 */
function minimumTotalDistance($robot, $factory) {
    ...
    ...
    ...
    /**
     * go to ./solution.php
     */
}

// Test cases
$robot = [0, 4, 6];
$factory = [[2, 2], [6, 2]];
echo minimumTotalDistance($robot, $factory);  // Output: 4

$robot = [1, -1];
$factory = [[-2, 1], [2, 1]];
echo minimumTotalDistance($robot, $factory);  // Output: 2
?>
```

### Explanation:

- **Sorting**: We sort `robot` and `factory` by positions to ensure we assign nearby robots to nearby factories.
- **DP Initialization**: Initialize `dp[0][0] = 0` since no robots repaired by no factories means zero distance.
- **Dynamic Programming Transition**:
   - For each factory `j`, we try repairing the `k` robots preceding it within its limit.
   - The total distance is accumulated in `sumDist`.
   - We update `dp[i][j]` with the minimum value after repairing `k` robots, considering the distance and previous states.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n * m * L)` where `n` is the number of robots, `m` is the number of factories, and `L` is the maximum limit of repairs any factory can handle.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n * m)` for the DP table.

This solution efficiently calculates the minimum travel distance for all robots to be repaired within their factory limits.
