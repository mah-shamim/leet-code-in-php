2429\. Minimize XOR

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Topics:** `Greedy`, `Bit Manipulation`

Given two positive integers `num1` and `num2`, find the positive integer `x` such that:

- `x` has the same number of set bits as `num2`, and
- The value `x XOR num1` is **minimal**.

**Note** that `XOR` is the bitwise XOR operation.

Return _the integer `x`. The test cases are generated such that `x` is **uniquely determined**_.

The number of **set bits** of an integer is the number of `1`'s in its binary representation.

**Example 1:**

- **Input:** num1 = 3, num2 = 5
- **Output:** 3
- **Explanation:** The binary representations of num1 and num2 are 0011 and 0101, respectively.
  The integer 3 has the same number of set bits as num2, and the value 3 XOR 3 = 0 is minimal.

**Example 2:**

- **Input:** num1 = 1, num2 = 12
- **Output:** 3
- **Explanation:** The binary representations of num1 and num2 are 0001 and 1100, respectively.
  The integer 3 has the same number of set bits as num2, and the value 3 XOR 1 = 2 is minimal.



**Constraints:**
- <code>1 <= num1, num2 <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>

**Hint:**
1. To arrive at a small xor, try to turn off some bits from num1
2. If there are still left bits to set, try to set them from the least significant bit



**Solution:**

The idea is to manipulate the bits of `num1` and match the number of set bits (`1`s) in `num2` while minimizing the XOR result. Here's the step-by-step approach:

### Steps:
1. **Count the Set Bits in `num2`:**
   - Find the number of `1`s in the binary representation of `num2`. Let's call this `setBitsCount`.

2. **Create a Result Number `x`:**
   - Start with `x = 0`.
   - From the binary representation of `num1`, preserve the `1`s in the most significant positions that match `setBitsCount`.
   - If there are not enough `1`s in `num1`, add extra `1`s starting from the least significant bit.

3. **Optimize XOR Result:**
   - By aligning the set bits of `x` with the most significant `1`s of `num1`, the XOR value will be minimized.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - Return the computed value of `x`.

Let's implement this solution in PHP: **[2429. Minimize XOR](https://github.com/mah-shamim/leet-code-in-php/tree/main/algorithms/002429-minimize-xor/solution.php)**

```php
<?php
/**
 * @param Integer $num1
 * @param Integer $num2
 * @return Integer
 */
function minimizeXor($num1, $num2) {
    ...
    ...
    ...
    /**
     * go to ./solution.php
     */
}

/**
 * Helper function to count the number of set bits in a number
 *
 * @param $num
 * @return int
 */
function countSetBits($num) {
    ...
    ...
    ...
    /**
     * go to ./solution.php
     */
}

// Test cases
echo minimizeXor(3, 5) . "\n"; // Output: 3
echo minimizeXor(1, 12) . "\n"; // Output: 3
?>
```

### Explanation:

1. **`countSetBits` Function:**
   - This function counts the number of `1`s in the binary representation of a number using a loop.

2. **Building `x`:**
   - First, the most significant `1`s from `num1` are retained in `x` to minimize the XOR value.
   - If more `1`s are required to match `setBitsCount`, they are added starting from the least significant bit (to keep the XOR minimal).

3. **Optimization:**
   - The XOR value is minimized by aligning the significant bits as much as possible between `num1` and `x`.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** _**O(32)**_, since the loop iterates a constant number of times (32 bits for integers).
- **Space Complexity:** _**O(1)**_, as no extra space is used apart from variables.

### Example Walkthrough:
#### Example 1:
- `num1 = 3 (0011)` and `num2 = 5 (0101)`.
- `setBitsCount = 2`.
- `x` starts as `0`.
- From `num1`, keep two most significant `1`s: `x = 3 (0011)`.
- `x XOR num1 = 0`, which is minimal.

#### Example 2:
- `num1 = 1 (0001)` and `num2 = 12 (1100)`.
- `setBitsCount = 2`.
- From `num1`, retain `1` and add one more bit to `x`: `x = 3 (0011)`.
- `x XOR num1 = 2`, which is minimal.

This ensures the correct and efficient computation of `x`.
