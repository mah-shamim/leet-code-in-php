2594\. Minimum Time to Repair Cars

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Topics:** `Array`, `Binary Search`

You are given an integer array `ranks` representing the **ranks** of some mechanics. <code>ranks<sub>i</sub></code> is the rank of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> mechanic. A mechanic with a rank `r` can repair n cars in <code>r * n<sup>2</sup></code> minutes.

You are also given an integer `cars` representing the total number of cars waiting in the garage to be repaired.

Return _the **minimum** time taken to repair all the cars_.

**Note:** All the mechanics can repair the cars simultaneously.

**Example 1:**

- **Input:** ranks = [4,2,3,1], cars = 10
- **Output:** 16
- **Explanation:**
  - The first mechanic will repair two cars. The time required is 4 * 2 * 2 = 16 minutes.
  - The second mechanic will repair two cars. The time required is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 minutes.
  - The third mechanic will repair two cars. The time required is 3 * 2 * 2 = 12 minutes.
  - The fourth mechanic will repair four cars. The time required is 1 * 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.
    It can be proved that the cars cannot be repaired in less than 16 minutes.

**Example 2:**

- **Input:** ranks = [5,1,8], cars = 6
- **Output:** 16
- **Explanation:**
  - The first mechanic will repair one car. The time required is 5 * 1 * 1 = 5 minutes.
  - The second mechanic will repair four cars. The time required is 1 * 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.
  - The third mechanic will repair one car. The time required is 8 * 1 * 1 = 8 minutes.
    It can be proved that the cars cannot be repaired in less than 16 minutes.



**Constraints:**

- <code>1 <= ranks.length <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
- `1 <= ranks[i] <= 100`
- <code>1 <= cars <= 10<sup>6</sup></code>


**Hint:**
1. For a predefined fixed time, can all the cars be repaired?
2. Try using binary search on the answer.



**Solution:**

We need to determine the minimum time required for a group of mechanics with different ranks to repair all the cars in a garage. Each mechanic's repair time is determined by their rank and the number of cars they repair. The goal is to minimize the maximum time taken by any mechanic.

### Approach
The problem can be efficiently solved using binary search on the possible time values. The key insight is to check if a given time `T` allows all cars to be repaired by the mechanics working simultaneously. For each mechanic with rank `r`, the maximum number of cars they can repair in time `T` is given by `floor(sqrt(T / r))`. We sum these values for all mechanics and check if the total is at least the number of cars needing repair. If it is, `T` is a feasible time, and we search for a smaller time; otherwise, we search for a larger time.

Let's implement this solution in PHP: **[2594. Minimum Time to Repair Cars](https://github.com/mah-shamim/leet-code-in-php/tree/main/algorithms/002594-minimum-time-to-repair-cars/solution.php)**

```php
<?php
/**
 * @param Integer[] $ranks
 * @param Integer $cars
 * @return Integer
 */
function repairCars($ranks, $cars) {
    ...
    ...
    ...
    /**
     * go to ./solution.php
     */
}

// Example Usage:
$ranks1 = [4, 2, 3, 1];
$cars1 = 10;
echo repairCars($ranks1, $cars1) . "\n"; // Output: 16

$ranks2 = [5, 1, 8];
$cars2 = 6;
echo repairCars($ranks2, $cars2) . "\n"; // Output: 16
?>
```

### Explanation:

1. **Binary Search Setup**: We initialize `low` to 1 and `high` to the maximum possible time, which is when the highest-ranked mechanic repairs all cars alone.
2. **Binary Search Loop**: In each iteration, we calculate the midpoint `mid` and check if all cars can be repaired within `mid` minutes.
3. **Feasibility Check**: For each mechanic's rank, we compute the maximum number of cars they can repair in `mid` minutes. Summing these values gives the total number of cars that can be repaired. If this sum meets or exceeds the required number of cars, `mid` is a feasible time, and we adjust the search range to find a smaller feasible time. Otherwise, we increase the search range.
4. **Termination**: The loop terminates when `low` equals `high`, which is the minimum feasible time.

This approach efficiently narrows down the possible minimum time using binary search, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n log(max_rank * cars^2)), where `n` is the number of mechanics.
