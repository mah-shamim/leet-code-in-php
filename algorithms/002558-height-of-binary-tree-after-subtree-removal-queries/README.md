2458\. Height of Binary Tree After Subtree Removal Queries

**Difficulty:** Hard

**Topics:** `Array`, `Tree`, `Depth-First Search`, `Breadth-First Search`, `Binary Tree`

You are given the `root` of a **binary tree** with `n` nodes. Each node is assigned a unique value from `1` to `n`. You are also given an array `queries` of size `m`.

You have to perform `m` **independent** queries on the tree where in the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> query you do the following:

- **Remove** the subtree rooted at the node with the value `queries[i]` from the tree. It is **guaranteed** that `queries[i]` will **not** be equal to the value of the root.

Return _an array `answer` of size `m` where `answer[i]` is the height of the tree after performing the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> query_.

**Note:**

- The queries are independent, so the tree returns to its **initial** state after each query.
- The height of a tree is the **number of edges in the longest simple path** from the root to some node in the tree.


**Example 1:**

![binaryytreeedrawio-1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/09/07/binaryytreeedrawio-1.png)

- **Input:** root = [1,3,4,2,null,6,5,null,null,null,null,null,7], queries = [4]
- **Output:** [2]
- **Explanation:** The diagram above shows the tree after removing the subtree rooted at node with value 4.\
  The height of the tree is 2 (The path 1 -> 3 -> 2).

**Example 2:**

![binaryytreeedrawio-2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/09/07/binaryytreeedrawio-2.png)

- **Input:** root = [5,8,9,2,1,3,7,4,6], queries = [3,2,4,8]
- **Output:** [3,2,3,2]
- **Explanation:** We have the following queries:
  - Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 3. The height of the tree becomes 3 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 2 -> 4).
  - Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 2. The height of the tree becomes 2 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 1).
  - Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 4. The height of the tree becomes 3 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 2 -> 6).
  - Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 8. The height of the tree becomes 2 (The path 5 -> 9 -> 3).


**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is `n`.
- <code>2 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
- `1 <= Node.val <= n`
- All the values in the tree are **unique**.
- `m == queries.length`
- <code>1 <= m <= min(n, 10<sup>4</sup>)</code>
- `1 <= queries[i] <= n`
- `queries[i] != root.val`


**Hint:**
1. Try pre-computing the answer for each node from 1 to n, and answer each query in O(1).
2. The answers can be precomputed in a single tree traversal after computing the height of each subtree.



**Solution:**

The solution employs a two-pass approach:
1. **Calculate the height of each node** in the tree.
2. **Determine the maximum height** of the tree after removing the subtree rooted at each queried node.

#### Code Breakdown

**1. Class Definition and Properties:**
```php
class Solution {

    private $valToMaxHeight = [];
    private $valToHeight = [];
```
- `valToMaxHeight`: This array will store the maximum height of the tree after removing each node's subtree.
- `valToHeight`: This array will store the height of each node's subtree.

**2. Main Function:**
```php
function treeQueries($root, $queries) {
    ...
    ...
    ...
    /**
     * go to ./solution.php
     */
}
```
- The function `treeQueries` takes the `root` of the tree and the `queries` array.
- It first calls the `height` function to compute the height of each node.
- Then, it calls the `dfs` (depth-first search) function to compute the maximum heights after subtree removals.
- Finally, it populates the `answer` array with the results for each query.

**3. Height Calculation:**
```php
private function height($node) {
    ...
    ...
    ...
    /**
     * go to ./solution.php
     */
}
```
- This function computes the height of each node recursively.
- If the node is `null`, it returns 0.
- If the height of the node is already computed, it retrieves it from the cache (`valToHeight`).
- It calculates the height based on the heights of its left and right children and stores it in `valToHeight`.

**4. Depth-First Search for Maximum Height:**
```php
private function dfs($node, $depth, $maxHeight) {
    ...
    ...
    ...
    /**
     * go to ./solution.php
     */
}
```
- This function performs a DFS to compute the maximum height of the tree after each node's subtree is removed.
- It records the current maximum height in `valToMaxHeight` for the current node.
- It calculates the heights of the left and right subtrees and updates the maximum height accordingly.
- It recursively calls itself for the left and right children, updating the depth and maximum height.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's go through an example step-by-step.

**Example Input:**
```php
// Tree Structure
//        1
//       / \
//      3   4
//     /   / \
//    2   6   5
//         \
//          7

$root = [1, 3, 4, 2, null, 6, 5, null, null, null, null, null, 7];
$queries = [4];
```

**Initial Height Calculation:**
- The height of the tree rooted at 1: `3`
- The height of the tree rooted at 3: `2`
- The height of the tree rooted at 4: `2` (height of subtrees rooted at 6 and 5)
- The height of the tree rooted at 6: `1` (just node 7)
- The height of the tree rooted at 2: `0` (leaf node)

After the height computation, `valToHeight` would look like this:
```php
$valToHeight = [
    1 => 3,
    2 => 0,
    3 => 2,
    4 => 2,
    5 => 0,
    6 => 1,
    7 => 0
];
```

**DFS for Max Heights:**
- For the root (1), removing subtree 4 leaves:
   - Left Height: 2 (rooted at 3)
   - Right Height: 1 (rooted at 5)
- Thus, the maximum height after removing 4 is `2`.

**Result Array After Queries:**
- For the query `4`, the result would be `[2]`.

### Final Output
The result for the input provided will be:
```php
// Output
[2]
```

This structured approach ensures that we efficiently compute the necessary heights and answer each query in constant time after the initial preprocessing. The overall complexity is _**O(n + m)**_, where _**n**_ is the number of nodes in the tree and _**m**_ is the number of queries.
